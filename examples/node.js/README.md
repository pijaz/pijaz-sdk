node.js example application
===========================

This example application showcases the basics of using the Pijaz SDK in [node.js](http://nodejs.org).


### Initial platform setup

See [Initial platform setup](https://github.com/pijaz/pijaz-sdk#initial-platform-setup) in the main README for the SDK.


### Application configuration

* Navigate to the same directory as this README file.
* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the application.
* Copy config.sample.js to config.js
* Edit the client application settings section of config.js, inserting the values for your configured application.
* Edit the product settings section of config.js. The example application expects a workflow that's identical to the 'Hello World' sample workflow created in the Theme designer.


### Running the application

* Run `node app.js` to start the application.

You should see some console output with the results of the three different products the example application produces.
